### What to use this application for?
This is meant to be a starter application that can help you to get familiar with working with Full-Stack web applications implementing Vue/Node.js/Express/Mongodb

This can be altered to become just about anything you need it to become. Although if wanting to create a larger scale application with more than a few components, I suggest also implementing Vuex on the client side for State management. It will help you to be able to scale up more easily than with Vue on its own.
